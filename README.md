# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Chest-X-Ray
A CNN-based pneumonia detection system built with TensorFlow, featuring data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization of results using chest X-ray images.

🫁 Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-Ray

This project implements a deep learning–based system for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the model classifies X-ray scans as either Pneumonia or Normal, providing an automated and efficient diagnostic aid.

📌 Features

✔️ Preprocessing of chest X-ray images

✔️ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model

✔️ Training, validation, and test evaluation

✔️ Accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix

✔️ Easy-to-run Jupyter Notebook
